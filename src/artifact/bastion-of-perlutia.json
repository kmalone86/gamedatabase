        "A divine weapon passed down in the Perlutia family that may only be wielded by those born to be leaders. It chooses its master of its own will and rearranges its dark, hexagonal pieces to take the form most optimal for any situation. It was locked away for decades with no one to wield it, but finally, it has found a new master to bring it back into the world."
